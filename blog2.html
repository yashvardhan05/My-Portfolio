          let's talk about CSS now,
          <br>
          CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. ... CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. <br>
          And we concluded now, after deciding the strucre and layout of the website by HTML, we design and align items using CSS.

          <br>
          JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. ... Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages. <br>
          so after making our website's layout and design it was time for some to make it interactive and dynamic so we do it using JavaScript

         Hey Folks, This is Yashvardhan
         <br>
         Talking about my academics i am currently in second year of my Engineering College and i am fully into Web Developement as of now. <br>
         The point is how i got started and how i got into programming, so for that let's roll back 2 and half years ago.

         <br>
         <br>
         I was on edge of my 12th std and boards exam were just on the door and i was finding an excuse to ditch the studies and by watching some hacking stuff from Hollywood, Bollywood movies <br> i was quite fascinated by Programming. So by that little 
         curiousity i ended up googling some things about programming. So the every search i was doing some websites used to show me information and i wandered how these websites they make. <br> <br> Like fully functional and animated so
         again i googled those things and got to introduced to Wordpress but when i did research about wordpress then i didn't actully liked it cause it was just drag and drop nothing 
         actual work. Then i again googled, "How to make websites by using programming languages"; so i founf about HTML and CSS and i was quite aware about HTML cause we've heard this name a lot in school's computer subject. <br><br>
         So finally i searched HTML tutorial and got full web developement tutorail on Youtube so i ended up watching that lil bit and got introduced to technologies like HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSRATP and JavaScript and many more.

         So after watching that Web Developement tutorial on Youtube i used to get distracted a lot by ads and YouTube recommendetions so i made decision to by an Udemy course for complete Web developement. <br> <br>
          So i bought course of Angel Yu which is the best selling course for web dev on Udemy platform. And it was my one of the best decision till date <br>
         i learnt so much things from there and then i got introduced to Tanay Pratap (Bhaiyya) and neoG camp. and now i started learning frm Tanay Bhaiyya's Videos and <br>
         and so many things i've learnt from here. Because of this knowledge i am writing this blog and i am able to make this portflio. So huge shoutout to Tanay Bhaiyya. <br>
